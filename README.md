# TutorConnect

TutorConnect helps students find nearby home tutors easily. BTech/PG tutors upload demo videos, and students compare teaching styles, browse by subject or location, and contact the tutor they like. The app bridges the gap between tutors who want to teach and students who need guidance.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or

# or
